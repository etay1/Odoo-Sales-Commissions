# Odoo - Sales Commissions

Developed during my Odoo internship to streamline commission calculations, ensuring equitable compensation for sales teams by extending the Sales and Invoicing applications.


## Description

Throughout my internship at Odoo, I was fortunate to actively contribute to the improvement of their Sales and Invoicing app, where my focus centered on the creation of a dedicated Sales Commission extension. The primary goal of this project was to optimize the calculation of commissions, ultimately leading to a smoother process for sales teams and guaranteeing precise compensation tied to their individual performance. This extension was developed with the intention of elevating the overall user experience within the realm of commission management.
